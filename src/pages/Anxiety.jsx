          Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) <br />
          (GAD-7) is a seven-item self-report questionnaire that
           uses some of the DSM-V criteria for GAD (General Anxiety Disorder)
            to measure worry and anxiety symptoms. It can also be used as a 
            screening tool and severity measure of panic, social anxiety, 
            and PTSD. GAD-7 is designed to assess the patient’s 
            health status during the previous 2 weeks.

                    people stop short of seeking help out of fear their concerns
                    aren’t legitimate or severe enough to warrant professional
                    intervention.
