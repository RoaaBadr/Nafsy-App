              Your results indicate that you are experiencing some signs of PTSD. <br />
              These results are not meant to be a diagnosis. You can meet with a doctor or

                    people stop short of seeking help out of fear their concerns
                    aren’t legitimate or severe enough to warrant professional
                    intervention.
